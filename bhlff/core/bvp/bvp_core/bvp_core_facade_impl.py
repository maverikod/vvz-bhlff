BVP Core Facade Implementation - Main implementation for BVP framework.

This module provides the main implementation for the BVP framework facade,
implementing all core operations for BVP envelope solving, quench detection,
and impedance computation.

Physical Meaning:
    The BVP Core Facade Implementation provides the concrete implementation
    for the central backbone of the entire system, where all observed
    particles and fields are manifestations of envelope modulations
    and beatings of the high-frequency carrier field.

Mathematical Foundation:
    BVP implements the envelope equation:
    ∇·(κ(|a|)∇a) + k₀²χ(|a|)a = s(x,φ,t)
    where κ(|a|) = κ₀ + κ₂|a|² is nonlinear stiffness and
    χ(|a|) = χ' + iχ''(|a|) is effective susceptibility with quenches.

Example:
    >>> bvp_core = BVPCoreFacade(domain, config, domain_7d)
    >>> envelope = bvp_core.solve_envelope(source)
    >>> quenches = bvp_core.detect_quenches(envelope)
