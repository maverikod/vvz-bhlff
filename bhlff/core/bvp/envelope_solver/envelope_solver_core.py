Core envelope solver facade for BVP envelope equation.

This module provides the main facade class for the envelope solver,
coordinating all components for solving the 7D BVP envelope equation.

Physical Meaning:
    Provides the main interface for solving the nonlinear 7D envelope
    equation ∇·(κ(|a|)∇a) + k₀²χ(|a|)a = s(x,φ,t) using advanced
    numerical methods in M₇ = ℝ³ₓ × 𝕋³_φ × ℝₜ.

Mathematical Foundation:
    Coordinates Newton-Raphson method with line search and regularization
    for robust solution of nonlinear 7D envelope equations.

Example:
    >>> core = EnvelopeSolverCore(domain, config)
    >>> residual = core.compute_residual(envelope, source)
    >>> jacobian = core.compute_jacobian(envelope)
